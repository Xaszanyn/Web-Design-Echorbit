        <h4>About us</h4>
        <p>
          Echorbit Audio began its journey before the advent of corporatization
          in 2019. At that time, Echorbit Audio was primarily engaged in
          organizing sound design libraries for games and films, as well as
          providing post-production services. In 2023, the company officially
          came into being.
        </p>
        <p>
          Echorbit Audio is a company that is growing and developing rapidly. It
          currently provides a wide range of services, including the production
          of sound design libraries for films and games, postproduction and
          music services, and sound implementation for games.
        </p>
        <p>
          Echorbit Audio was founded with the aim of providing sound design and
          post-production services. In its early years, the company established
          its position in the industry by working with independent producers and
          small game studios. It quickly grew, forming partnerships with major
          film production companies and international game developers. Known for
          its innovative approach and customerfocused service, Echorbit Audio
          aims to add value to projects by delivering high-quality sound design
          and post-production solutions for the gaming and film industries.
        </p>
        <p>

          studios. Over the years, through a commitment to quality and
          innovation, Echorbit Audio expanded its portfolio and began working
          with major film production houses and globally recognized game
          developers.
