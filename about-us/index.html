        <p>
          Echorbit Audio began its journey before the advent of corporatization
          in 2019. At that time, Echorbit Audio was primarily engaged in
          organizing sound design libraries for games and films, as well as
          providing post-production services. In 2023, the company officially
          came into being.

          its innovative approach and customerfocused service, Echorbit Audio
          aims to add value to projects by delivering high-quality sound design
